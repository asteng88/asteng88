- 👋 Hi, I’m @asteng88
- 👀 I’m interested in python programming to make tools that I have needed for certain tasks. Seeing as I have obtained much of this knowledge for free, all of my work is open source.
- 🌱 I’m currently using PyQt6 & Tkinter as a front end development for my python GUI's
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
